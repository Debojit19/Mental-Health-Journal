# Mental Health Journal
 This project is an online platform where users can record their thoughts and feelings in a journal, categorize them by mood, and receive relevant suggestions. The application offers the following features:  Mood-based Suggestions: The app provides tailored suggestions depending on the user's current emotional state. Suggestions include songs, jokes, and food recommendations that aim to improve or match the user's mood. Journal Entries: Users can write their thoughts in a text area and save them. Entries are stored locally in the browser's storage and can be viewed later. Mood Buttons: Users can select from a variety of moods (e.g., happy, sad, anxious) by clicking on corresponding buttons. Each mood triggers different suggestions designed to enhance or help users cope with that mood. Song Suggestions: A playlist is recommended for each mood, offering tracks to complement or uplift the userâ€™s emotional state. Food Suggestions: Depending on the user's mood, food ideas are suggested, such as comfort foods for a sad mood or energizing snacks for an excited mood. Jokes: Light-hearted jokes are offered based on the selected mood to promote humor and alleviate stress. Previous Entries: The app stores past journal entries, allowing users to review their reflections over time.
